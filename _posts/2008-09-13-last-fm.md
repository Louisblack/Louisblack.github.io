Now I know I&#8217;m late again on this one but I&#8217;ve just started using [Last.fm][1]. For anyone who hasn&#8217;t heard of it, it&#8217;s a music recommendation site where you type in (or import from iTunes) a list of your favourite bands and it recommends music to you based on this information. You can also just search for music like (insert band name) and it&#8217;ll play you a seemingly never ending playlist of songs from bands in the same genre. You are also given the option to add songs as they play to your &#8216;love this&#8217; list or banned list.

  At the moment I&#8217;m listening to music like <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mogwai">Mogwai</a> and I&#8217;ve already made a list of bands I need to buy albums from. Some highlights are <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Mono">Mono</a> and <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/This+Will+Destroy+You">This Will Destroy You</a>. I wasn&#8217;t aware of the fact that there are so many good instrumental post rock bands around. I&#8217;m very picky about vocalists in bands and I often finding myself liking the music and hating the voice &#8211; these bands do away with that problem which is probably why I pretty much like them all.
