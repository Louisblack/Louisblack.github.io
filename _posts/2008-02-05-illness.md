I&#8217;m ill for the second day today. I was good though and went to see the doctor. He thinks it&#8217;s just a virus that has been going round, which is a relief as I thought my sore throat might have been the start of yet another bout of tonsillitis. I usually get tonsillitis about two of three times a year and it completely debilitates me for a week.

  Other than that, on Sunday I picked up a digital camera &#8211; mainly for use on our holiday this summer. It&#8217;s a Sony Cybershot DSC-W55. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to really test it out as I haven&#8217;t left the house much because of illness and rain. The pictures I&#8217;ve taken in the flat look quite nice &#8211; a lot better than the slightly under performing camera on my Sony Erikson K800i (3.2 Megapixel).

  I also picked up a 4GB Memory Stick from Amazon. It was £20 new from a Marketplace seller &#8211; not a bad deal I think considering I paid £60 for a 1GB stick just over two years ago.
