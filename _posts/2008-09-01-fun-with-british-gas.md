Good ol&#8217; British Gas. This rather astonishing bill came through the door today. It is, of course, wrong. Just like every other bill we have recieved from this awful company. Jordan is currently waiting for them to call us back so we can get this stupid mess sorted out. They are two hours late in calling.

I think I can safely say that British Gas has outdone NTL in complete idiocy and I am often known for complaining about my year using NTL Internet and dealing with their customer service.
