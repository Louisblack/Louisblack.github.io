Almost two weeks ago now I finally finished the two OU modules I&#8217;ve been suffering with for a good portion of 2014. I [wrote back in April][1] about the quality of level 3 computing modules and my opinions only hardened as I slogged away at the work. A few months after that last blog post I even considered packing it all in as I wasn&#8217;t really learning anything useful and studying two level 3 courses concurrently meant that my time was being wiped out. Luckily I got some advice and decided to stick with it. I&#8217;ve now just got one more module and my final project to complete.

M363 sounds like it should be cool. It&#8217;s user friendly name is Software engineering with objects. It ended up being 6 months of UML diagrams and requirements analysis followed by a couple of months on managerial techniques, basic QA and stuff like estimating how long a project might take. I can&#8217;t remember writing any code which is pretty shit for a module called Software Engineering with Objects.

The exam ended up being relatively easy to revise for. I felt confident going in and think I did pretty well. Annoyingly I didn&#8217;t do well enough in the assignments to get a first overall even if I aced the exam but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve got a 2:1.

M364 is a module focusing on Interaction Design. I think there was definitely some interesting material in there somewhere but it ended up being lost in the huge amounts of reading. The OU supply you with a copy of the book Interaction Design: beyond human computer interaction which is an 800 page beast that could easily be distilled down into less than half of that.

The marking for the assignments I think suffered from the inherent subjectivity of the course. Analysing websites and interactive products based on their usability and user experience can lead to lots of opinions being thrown around &#8211; some you can back up and some you can&#8217;t. This lead to some varied marks. I got as low as 75% and as high as 98% on my assignments.

The exam is where things got very annoying though. The course is filled with lists of things &#8211; usability goals, user experience goals,  Hofstede&#8217;s cultural dimensions, evaluation methods with their advantages and disadvantages. I&#8217;m not fantastic at remembering lists of words &#8211; I prefer getting my head around concepts. I did four past papers in preparation and in every one they managed to find a new list of things for you to regurgitate. Sometimes that list was mentioned just once in the course book&#8217;s 800 pages.

I don&#8217;t think I did very well in the exam but because of its subjective nature it&#8217;s hard to tell. I&#8217;ll find out in December.

Luckily the OU is refreshing its level 3 courses over the next few years so hopefully these modules will be retired or re-written.
