  Right&#8230; well. I&#8217;ve always known about the &#8216;blog this&#8217; option when taking photos on my Sony k800i but I have never used it. Today I was bored at work and decided to take the plunge and choose that option on one of my pictures. It sent the picture of my cat Fritz off to this website and gave me a url and a code so I thought I should probably have a look.
