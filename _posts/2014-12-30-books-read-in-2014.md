It&#8217;s that time of year again. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to finish The Lovely Bones before Thursday so this is my list of books for 2014.

I ended up abandoning Homicide &#8211; A Year on the Killing Streets, the book that The Wire is based on, about half way in. It was alright but reading about Baltimore&#8217;s crime problems in a hammock in Costa Rica didn&#8217;t feel right. I also tried to read Naked Lunch but couldn&#8217;t get more than a couple of chapters into it.

My favourites of the year were Lucifer&#8217;s Hammer and The Martian &#8211; strangely enough both sci fi.

  1. Masters of Doom &#8211; David Kushner
  2. Life On Air &#8211; David Attenborough
  3. The Ocean at the End of the Lane &#8211; Neil Gaiman
  4. MaddAddam &#8211; Margaret Atwood
  5. On The Road &#8211; Jack Kerouac
  6. Into the Wild &#8211; Jon Krakauer
  7. The Returned &#8211; Jason Mott
  8. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer &#8211; Mark Twain
  9. The Fall of Moondust &#8211; Arthur C. Clarke
 10. Lucifer&#8217;s Hammer &#8211; Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle
 11. Death in a Northern Town &#8211; Peter Mckeirmen
 12. Lair &#8211; James Herbert
 13. The Cipher &#8211; Kathe Koja
 14. A Journey to the Centre of the Earth &#8211; Jules Verne
 15. The Incredible Human Journey &#8211; Alice Roberts
 16. To Kill A Mockingbird &#8211; Harper Lee
 17. Twelve Years a Slave &#8211; Solomon Northup
 18. The Plague &#8211; Albert Camus
 19. The Haunting of Hill House &#8211; Shirley Jackson
 20. The Martian &#8211; Andy Weir
 21. The Fall &#8211; Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan
 22. On The Beach &#8211; Nevil Shute Norway
