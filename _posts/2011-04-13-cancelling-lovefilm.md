After being a Lovefilm member on and off for about 4 years I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m not really taking full advantage of the service and it&#8217;s not really fitting in with my life. It&#8217;s a bit sad because it&#8217;s actually a really good idea and I&#8217;ve managed to watch some films that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have without the service.

The problems really started when I bought a Blu Ray player and moved as many of the films in my queue to BR as I could. From my experience it looks like Lovefilm don&#8217;t stock as many BRs as they should. Even with 10 or so discs on my list at high priority I would still be sent a random film from my medium priority list. This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad but I usually have a lot of crap on medium priority that I added on a whim and have forgotten to take off. In the worse case I had watched the film on TV a few weeks before and forgotten to take it off so was sent a film I had seen. I know this has a lot to do with my disorganisation but when you have 10 films on high priority you expect one of them to be sent.

Another part of the Lovefilm service that I think hasn&#8217;t really reached its potential is the Lovefilm Player. Quality is really quite awful on a 42&#8243; 1080p TV and performance on my Atom/ION HTPC is pretty terrible. 1080p YouTube videos play perfectly but the 360pish Lovefilm videos stutter horribly.

To replace Lovefilm (because we can&#8217;t do without our movies) we&#8217;ve just upgraded our Sky package to HD. We already had the movie package but with an ancient box with a tiny 40GB hard drive. Upgrading to HD means a shiny new HD box with a 320GB  hard drive (120GB reserved for Anytime) which leaves lots of room to keep recorded films. It&#8217;s also nice that every film is in HD.

So far we&#8217;ve actually managed to record a few films that we&#8217;ve had on the Lovefilm list for a while. It&#8217;s more of an effort  to catch good films when you have to trawl through pages of TV listings on the Sky website but features like <a title="remote record" href="http://mysky.sky.com/portal/site/skycom/mysky/remoterecord/howto?contentid=3347410" target="_blank">Remote Record</a> make the process a lot easier.

I&#8217;m a little sad that I&#8217;m giving more money to Sky rather than a nice company like Lovefilm but at the moment I&#8217;m just happier with the service.
