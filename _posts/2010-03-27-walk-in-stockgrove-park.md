I&#8217;ve had a nice afternoon spent wondering around <a href="http://www.greensandtrust.org/stockPark.html" target="_blank">Stockgrove Park</a> with Jordan, Colin and Colin&#8217;s dog Blue. We walked through the park and then stopped off at a local pub for a swift pint and then ventured back. Unfortunately I only remembered that I have a walking application for my iPhone that tracks your route and gives you a load of interesting information like distance travelled and calories burnt. The app is called <a href="http://www.abvio.com/walkmeter/" target="_blank">Walkmeter</a>. So this is a map for the walk back from the pub to the car park.
