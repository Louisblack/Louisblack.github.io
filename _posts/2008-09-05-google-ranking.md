After changing my sub heading on this blog to something containing my full name, I now actually come up on the first page of Google results when you type in my name. I have always been a little miffed that my name didn&#8217;t link to me in any way on the net but now it does.

My internet pseudonym Louisblack (one word) however reveals my many little homes around the web. In the top five results we have my [Flickr][1], my [Macrumors profile][2], my [M][3][yspace][3] and my [Y][4][outube profile][4]. Stupid [Austinist.com][5] and their tags. I could have been five for five there as my now defunct Livejournal page is hanging around at result number seven.
