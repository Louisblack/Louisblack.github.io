I&#8217;ve been doing an Open University degree in Computing for the past 4 years now. It&#8217;s definitely had its ups (writing my first line of code, introducing me to Java) and downs (*that* team working module) but on the most part it&#8217;s been pretty interesting and I&#8217;ve been happy with most modules I&#8217;ve done. In fact, after doing three modules of Java I got myself a job writing Java full time.

The problem is that fact that the quality of the module choices drops off dramatically at level 3. Last year I did the only module that sounded interesting and had decent reviews (Developing Concurrent, Distributed Systems) which was dated but still useful.

This has left me with a pretty poor choice this year. I&#8217;ve ended up doing The Fundamentals of Interaction Design which is a six year old course that feels dated and any useful material is lost in the plentiful, dry reading. I&#8217;m also doing Software Engineering With Objects that is just a lesson in UML and actually just seems to be rehashing material from a module I did last year.

I think I&#8217;m just disappointed because I expected level 3 modules to cover more meaty subjects as the level 2 ones had laid down a good foundation of language skills. We could be writing a compiler to better understand what&#8217;s going on when we hit build or building a game engine with basic physics and AI. I know that&#8217;s all stuff you can learn independently but so it everything else on the course so why not offer advanced students something a bit more computer sciencey.

It also doesn&#8217;t help that these two modules still take up a good chunk of my time. I&#8217;d rather be doing something a bit more interesting like learning Angular.js or building something with an Arduino.

After these I have one more proper module, Algorithms, data structures and compatibility (using Python) which actually sounds pretty fun, and then it&#8217;s final project time.
