A few of my friends own the HTC Desire Android phone. From what I&#8217;ve seen of it it looks like a pretty amazing phone. Who would have thought, even 5 years ago, that we would have a phone powered by a 1GHz processor?

Today one of these friends posted this on Twitter &#8211;

Now anyone interested in technology knows that their brand new, top of the range toy is going to be old news in a very short space of time. It&#8217;s just the way things are. But the pace at which Android phones are progressing is hugely impressive. HTC seem to be bringing out an updated model precisely every 6 minutes night and day.

Whilst this speedy march of tech is by no means a bad thing I do think it leads to buyers remorse in the more fickle consumer. Of course these people are going to feel this way no matter what but at least it used to be the case that they would buy a phone and have bragging rights for 6 months or so. It&#8217;s not even close to that now. I can see this making the now almost ubiquitous two year contract seem like a really long time even to the average consumer. I suppose this just highlights the importance of research. Don&#8217;t buy when a new product is imminent (although as I mentioned this seems to be all of the time) and make sure you get the best product you can afford so you aren&#8217;t left behind during that long two year contract.

Of course, these are just the thoughts of an outsider. My current phone is an iPhone 3G. I am planning to upgrade to the 4th generation model in June. I was slightly tempted by the Desire but I&#8217;m hoping that the new iPhone will at least match it technology wise. I have also invested heavily in games and apps from the App Store so I would have spend a fair amount just to replace the functionality I get at the moment. I will also be safe in the knowledge that my phone will be top dog (relative to other iPhones of course) for at least a year.
