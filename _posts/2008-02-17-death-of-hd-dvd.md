I haven&#8217;t posted for a while but I promise I have been thinking about it. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be a few posts in a short space of time.

  I saw <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/c.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Farticle%2FcompanyNewsAndPR%2FidUSL1627196120080216&t=1203265502">this</a> today. Apparently Toshiba have stopped production of their high definition disk format. I have always been a big supporter of Blu Ray (this may be due to my rather fan boy-ish relationship with Sony), so this news couldn&#8217;t have come fast enough. I have been keeping an eye on this format war since day one and I always thought the situation was a real problem. No one had any idea which format was going to win and all that has happened is we have a few million people with a rather expensive upscaling DVD player&#8230; oh well, hopefully this will lead to the low cost brands such as Goodmans and Alba making a series of cheap (but a bit crap) players like we have seen with LCD TVs and the format can really start to displace DVD.

  Now I just need to see the PS3 dropping below Â£200 and I&#8217;ll be happy to pick up a Blu Ray player&#8230;
