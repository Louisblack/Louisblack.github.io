Damn&#8230;

  Today is an example of how even with lots of technology that make life lots easier my forgetfulness will always prevail. This morning I was flicking through eBay and found a last generation iBook which was at about £60 with a couple of hours to go. The seller wrote that it didn&#8217;t boot, it just went to a screen with a folder and a question mark. This just means that the hard drive might be dead or even that the installation of OS X is corrupt. I have a couple of spare hard drives around and a Leopard disk so this would be perfect. I made a note to check back before the auction ended.

  Of course&#8230; I forgot. I just checked the auction now to see what it went for and it went for the measly sum of £123 with £20 P&P. They usually sell for around £350-£400.
