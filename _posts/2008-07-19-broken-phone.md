I thought I should probably post again regarding what I wrote yesterday. I was mainly talking about in our price range&#8230; we have since found a few English or French restaurants but they are on the more expensive end of the spectrum.

I also thought I better post and say my phone has died. I&#8217;m not sure what finally did it but it has been on it&#8217;s way out for a while. The little joy stick didn&#8217;t go up and pictures kept coming up as scrambled. Oh well, it just means that as soon as I get a job I will <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span> to invest in a 3G iPhone&#8230; it just wouldn&#8217;t be proper not to.

Oh&#8230; and Jordan&#8217;s phone doesn&#8217;t work in Japan so at the moment we are uncontactable by phone.
