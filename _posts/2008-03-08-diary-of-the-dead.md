I was pleasantly surprised on Tuesday of last week when I discovered that the new Romero Dead film was being released this week.

  I was, however, less than pleasantly surprised when I actually went to the cinema to see it on Friday. I&#8217;m not sure I like the emerging &#8216;found film&#8217; genre  that we&#8217;ve been seeing recently. I absolutely despised &#8216;The Zombie Diaries&#8217; &#8211; a low budget British attempt at the zombie genre that was presented in the form of &#8216;found footage&#8217;.  Cloverfield is probably the best recent attempt although it still suffered from annoying characters and awful acting&#8230;

  I think that is the real trouble with these films.  When watching a regular film, we expect the acting to be just that &#8211; acting.  The action is stylized and we accept this because it is a film&#8230; it&#8217;s not real.  This does not work when a film is masquerading as a documentary or a home video (with the obvious exception of Rob Reiner&#8217;s Spinal Tap, Best in Show&#8230; etc).  The audience has to be completely convinced that the actors are real people dealing with real (although completely impossible) events.

  Anywho&#8230; Diary of The Dead has all of these faults and more and this is coming from someone who loves all four of the other movies&#8230; hell, I even love the Tom Savini remake of Night of The Living Dead. The acting is atrocious, the characters are arseholes and the story is almost non existent.

  I think the real problem is the lack of claustrophobia.  The thing that made the original trilogy, and to a lesser extent Land of the Dead, great was the interaction between the characters while they were holed up either in a house, a shopping mall, an underground bunker or a fortified city. Zombies are just a sideline in these films &#8211; a threat that brings a group of mismatched people together and forces them to cooperate (or not) to survive.

  I did, however, enjoy the &#8216;zombies don&#8217;t run&#8217; jokes. You&#8217;re right George, they really don&#8217;t.
