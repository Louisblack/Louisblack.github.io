I&#8217;m sure that anyone who is remotely interested in technology, Apple in particular, will have heard of the small company [Psystar][1] who have recently hit the headlines with their Open Mac. For the rest of you, the Open Mac is a regular PC that is (apparently) able to run OS X with no difficult fiddling. You can even order it with Leopard pre-installed.

  Sounds fishy? You&#8217;d be right.

  Over the last few days several websites have been trying to contact Psystar to get some details. A few have succeeded in getting a phone interview with the Director of the company but nothing new has really been learnt. The most details came about when the Guardian&#8217;s Charles Arthur did some <a href="http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/04/15/so_exactly_who_or_what_is_psystar_we_dig_a_little.html">digging</a>. He couldn&#8217;t find anything about Psystar from before this week and the company isn&#8217;t even listed with the Miami Chamber of Commerce.

  Hmmm.

  The best bit came when Charles did a google map search for the address and found it to be a small residential home. A few minutes later the address had changed to an industrial estate. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/380488/psystar-exposed-looks-like-a-hoax">Gizmodo</a> popped down to this address and found no trace of the company&#8230;

  I&#8217;m loving this little mystery. I hope no one got caught up in the hype and actually ordered one of these things because it&#8217;s looking more and more likely that they will never see their much anticipated Hackintosh.

  I wonder what surprises tomorrow holds!
