Last Friday we picked up our second cat. We originally replied to the advert about him a couple of months ago, just after he had been born, so we&#8217;ve been waiting to get him for a while. The advantage of getting in touch with the owner so early is that we get pictures of him as a very young baby.

It didn&#8217;t take him long to settle in once we got him home. He was running round like a mad man within a few minutes. It wasn&#8217;t long until he was crashed out on the bed. We&#8217;ve named him Sailor after Nicolas Cage&#8217;s character in the David Lynch film &#8216;Wild at Heart&#8217;.

Over the last few days we have been slowly trying to introduce him to our other cat Fritz. Fritz is a little confused by the situation. He&#8217;s given Sailor a good bat with his paw a couple of times but that&#8217;s really to be expected. The vet reckons he&#8217;s just showing dominance. Lets hope so. We have decided that if things don&#8217;t work out within a few months we might have to look into alternatives. But I doubt that will happen.

Events like this just prove to me that Jordan and I should never have children. Jordan was trying to tell people that looking after him was just like looking after a new born baby. Jordan would be in for a shock if she had children&#8230;
