I haven&#8217;t posted for a while so I decided I should probably say hello so that people don&#8217;t think that we have been sold into prostitution by triads.

We arrived in Hong Kong on Friday and had to rush to our guesthouse because if we didn&#8217;t get there by 10pm, they would let out our room. So we jumped onto the airport express and grabbed a taxi to our guesthouse in Causeway Bay on Hong Kong Island.

Oh yeah&#8230; I completely forgot that I haven&#8217;t mentioned the situation with our accommodation in Hong Kong. We were originally meant to stay in the notorious [Chungking Mansions][1]. &#8216;It&#8217;ll be an experience&#8217; we naively said as we placed our booking through [Hostels.com][2]. We have learnt a few things over the last 2 months. One of which is that we are pretty terrible backpackers. We dislike &#8216;slumming it&#8217;. So when we checked out some [recent reviews ][3]about the Hong Kong hostel we quickly decided it might not be the best idea to stay there. We managed to get into a guesthouse on Hong Kong Island for around the same price and we are much happier staying here than the more &#8216;colourful&#8217; Kowloon.

As you can see from the picture, the smog here is awful. We have only had one day of blue skies and the rest have been like the picture. On a plus note we have found ourselves a nice local pub and a local restaurant where we can get two huge bowls on noodle soup with two milkshakes for 68HK$.<br clear="all" />
