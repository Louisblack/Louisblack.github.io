In my [last post](/2016/02/three-months-with-hybris) I talked about how much I disliked working with Hybris. Ultimately I disliked it so much that I decided to move companies. I write code at least eight hours a day so if I'm not enjoying it then I have a big problem. It's a shame because there were lots of good things about the job outside of the code. This post looks at some of them.

### Regular deployments

### Nice office

### Tech talk Friday

### Open to change (just not away from Hybris)

### Choose your own OS and IDE

### Mandatory code reviews

### Git!
