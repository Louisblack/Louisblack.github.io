After over five years I&#8217;m finally on the home stretch of my OU degree in Computing. I just need to finish one module that ends in June and complete my final project in September.

I&#8217;ve chosen to do a development project as that&#8217;s the area that I think I can most shine. It isn&#8217;t, however, just a case of hacking together some code and submitting it. Decisions need to be justified and a large part of your mark comes from the planning of the project and reflection on how things went at the end.

This means I&#8217;m going to have to write a whole bunch of stuff about tools I&#8217;m going to use and decisions I make. I might as well do that here so I&#8217;ve got a good record. Let&#8217;s hope I actually keep it up.

Code and other stuff is hosted hereÂ [https://github.com/Louisblack/Final-Project][1]. At the moment it&#8217;s just some skeleton projects.
