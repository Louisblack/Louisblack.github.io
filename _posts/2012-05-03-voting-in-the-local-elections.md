So the local elections are upon us and with them come the first time I have to actually choose a party to vote for. Previously I would have voted Lib Dem but since forming the coalition and going back on several key election promises I&#8217;ve lost all faith in them. I know local politics are fairly separate from state politics but the association is there and I&#8217;d like to show Cleggy how pissed off I am at him.

So this leaves me with the choice between the other lefty parties &#8211; Labour and the Greens. I reckon I probably will vote Labour when the next general election rolls round because it&#8217;ll be the only way to oust the Tories but in the local elections I feel I have a bit more choice.

I&#8217;m seriously thinking about voting Green. I support a lot of what the Green party stands for in regards to the environment but I&#8217;ve never voted for them before. Partly because it was always seen as a wasted vote but also because I fundamentally disagree with their stance on subjects concerning science. Today I saw [this Reddit post][1] in which someone with exactly my thoughts voted Green but then e-mailed the party to explain their stance. In the e-mail they write that whilst they agree with many of the Green&#8217;s policies, the party&#8217;s stance on nuclear power and GM crops for example is &#8216;naive and dangerous&#8217;.

This sums up my thoughts exactly and I&#8217;m leaning towards doing the same thing.

On a side note I thought I better add how disappointed I am with the amount of information available on the people we&#8217;re voting for here in Milton Keynes. All we get on the council website is a list of names next to the parties. I have no idea what these people stand for. I tweeted the [@MKCouncil ][2]twitter account to find out if any of the candidates blogged or used Twitter but 5 hours later I&#8217;ve not heard anything. Googling their names doesn&#8217;t bring up anything interesting either.

It just means that people end up voting based on their ideological views of each party as opposed to proper policies. For all I know the Green candidate is opposed to a load of stuff I support. Maybe the Tory candidate and I have very similar views (I doubt it somehow). There&#8217;s no way to tell because there seems to be nothing about these people online.

Anyway, hopefully the rain will hold off long enough to walk down to the polling station.
