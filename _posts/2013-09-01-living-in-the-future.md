A few years ago I was walking home from work and as I walked through the front door I thought to myself &#8216;wouldn&#8217;t it be really cool if I could continue listening to the song I was listening to on my iPhone on the stereo in the house as I walked through the door?&#8217;

Well, today I walked home listening to music on my phone through my headphones. I walked through the door and swapped the output from headphones to the stereo in the kitchen. I made some toast and then changed the output to the stereo in the living room and sat down to write this. The music didn&#8217;t stop once.

Isn&#8217;t living in the future grand?
