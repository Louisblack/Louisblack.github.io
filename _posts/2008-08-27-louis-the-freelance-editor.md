I&#8217;ve just arrived home from a meeting with Media Circus. They are an advertising agency based in Leicester Square and they want to move into creating band promos. For this they need editors and that is what I hope to be.

  I have been given a couple of tapes of live footage from a band called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/catsandcriminals">Cats and Criminals</a>. I&#8217;m having a listen now and they aren&#8217;t exactly my thing but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be able to fling something exciting together. They have a cool logo that I&#8217;m thinking of taking advantage of.

  This is (of course) unpaid for the moment but it could lead to a permanent position and I can at least add it to my show reel and put it on my CV.
