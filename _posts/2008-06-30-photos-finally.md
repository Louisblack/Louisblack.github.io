By the time I finish writing this, all of the pictures so far should be uploaded to [my Flickr account][1]. We had to get out of our hostel at 10am today and our bus isn&#8217;t until 6 so we have had to kill a few hours. We found an internet cafe that has gaming facilities so the connection is really good.

That&#8217;s all for now.
