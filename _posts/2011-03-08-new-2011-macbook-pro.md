Shortly after my last post where I was having trouble selling my Macbook Pro I actually managed to find a sane buyer. I had to deliver it which required driving half an hour there and back but I didn&#8217;t mind as it gave me the cash needed to put towards the 2011 Macbook. As I&#8217;m lucky enough to qualify for higher education discount it only required me put £75 towards the new laptop. Seeing as it&#8217;s going to take me around five years to finish this Open University course, I can&#8217;t see why I can&#8217;t just upgrade each year and have the latest and greatest for next to nothing.

Overall it&#8217;s pretty similar to last year&#8217;s model. The only cosmetic difference is the Thunderbolt logo taking the place of the display icon next to the mini DisplayPort. (edit. I&#8217;ve just realised that it would make sense to mention that Thunderbolt is a new interface with a transfer speed to 10 Gbps.)

&nbsp;

The real changes are internal. Apple have finally dumped the ageing and positively (by computer standards) ancient Core 2 Duo in favour of Core i5s and i7s. I only picked up the low end 13&#8243; Macbook Pro which is powered by an i5. Accordingly to <a title="Macbook Pro benchmarks" href="http://www.macrumors.com/2011/02/25/new-macbook-pro-benchmarks-show-massive-improvement/" target="_blank">early benchmarks</a> the low end 13&#8243; is as fast as last year&#8217;s top end 17&#8243; in terms of processing. This is all thanks to Intel&#8217;s new Sandy Bridge processors that were only released a week or so ago.

As with <a href="http://louishoughton.com/geek/macbook-pro/" target="_blank">last year</a> my main complaint is with the GPU. Last year Apple used an Nvidia integrated graphics chip that wasn&#8217;t spectacular but it got the job done. Due to the increasingly annoying licensing issues between Nvidia and Intel, this year we don&#8217;t even get an Nvidia GPU. We&#8217;re stuck with the GPU integrated into the processor. I need to fire up Portal and see how things run but I&#8217;m not really expecting much and I wouldn&#8217;t even be surprised if graphics performance was worse than last year.

Really that&#8217;s all there is to say. Everything from last year&#8217;s post still stands as overall the laptop hasn&#8217;t really changed very much. The design is still great and the build quality is superb. The multitouch trackpad is still a joy to use and made even better with <a href="http://blog.boastr.net/?page_id=1722" target="_blank">BetterTouchTool</a>. £75 well spent I&#8217;d say!
