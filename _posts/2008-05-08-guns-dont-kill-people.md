&#8230; the police do apparently.  Only joking! Although I often made my views on the shooting of [Jean Charles De Menezes][1] very clear to anyone that would hear them, it seems that the recent police shooting of Mark Saunders was fairly justified.  However, the Guardian have run a [piece][2] about how he was shot &#8216;a number of times&#8217; as the police disabled him. The family are also quoted as saying &#8216;he didn&#8217;t endanger anyone at all to my knowledge&#8217;.

  Sorry, but the man had a shotgun which he was using to shoot at his neighbours houses.

  From the reporting so far, it seems that the police officers has just cause to shoot the man. I agree that when dealing with these situations, the officer should always aim to disable the target &#8211; preferably not killing him, but if the target sustains fatal wounds then it really can&#8217;t be avoided.

  I know this post sounds really a little right-wing, and for that I apologise, I really do, but people really shouldn&#8217;t be walking around with shotguns. I know he had a license for it, but why are we even still issuing licenses for firearms?

  And who needs a shotgun in Chelsea?
