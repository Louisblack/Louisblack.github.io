I booked our flight from Hong Kong to Tokyo this week. We ran into a bit of trouble with Tokyo as it seems that travel companies aren&#8217;t really too fond of the little island of Japan.

  Our original plan was to fly in with Air New Zealand and then get a one way ticket to Hong Kong as Air New Zealand doesn&#8217;t fly out of Tokyo. This, however, turned out to cost around £700 each.

  Instead we had to change our flight so we went straight to Hong Kong and then look into getting a return to Tokyo.  A return is considerably cheaper than a one way ticket. Although this did throw up a positive in the sense that we get to spend a night and half a day in Taipei.

  So this is the last flight booked and once we book our Greyhound bus from L.A. to San Francisco we will have all of our travel booked. Huzzah.
