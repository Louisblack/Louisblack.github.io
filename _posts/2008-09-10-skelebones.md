On Wednesday mornings we have to vacate the house as the cleaner comes and (strangely enough) cleans. This usually includes breakfast out and then a fair amount of time killing until we can return at 12 o&#8217;clock. Today Jordan and I decided to head over to the [Skeletons of London][1] exhibit at the Wellcome Collection in Euston.

  It was fairly odd experience staring at long dead bodies and reading about their lives &#8211; most of which included a good deal of rickets, gout and dental problems. There were even a few that were excavated from a similar area that all exhibited signs of facial damage thought to be caused to drunken behaviour. Not much has changed in London in 200 years then.

  The skeletons&#8217; ages range from about 1900 years old to about 150. They are in various states of wholeness&#8230; some only having a few limbs and about 2 ribs and others only missing the tips of their fingers. One even had had a craniotomy which gave us the opportunity to peak inside the cavity&#8230; spooky.

  All in all, a very fun and interested hour or so was spent staring at these skinless fellows.  Not bad for a free exhibition.
