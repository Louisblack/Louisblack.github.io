Apologies again for the lack of posts. I&#8217;ve had a bit of a hectic week with all the joblessness and looking for work.  Not to mention the fact that my flat is a bit of a guest house at the moment. We had two friends staying for the week and another who just likes to crash here&#8230; it was crowded to say the least.  I have, therefore, spent most of my time entertaining guests not to mention also helping my girlfriend with university essays.

  All of these things add up to one thing&#8230; not a lot of activity in my usual life. I don&#8217;t think I watched a single movie last week (hence no Movies of last week post) as the living room TV and my bedroom iMac (my girlfriend&#8217;s TiBook died last week also) were constantly engaged.

  I have, however, found myself acceptable temporary employment at The Pensions Regulator telling businesses to hurry up and fill in their updated details.
