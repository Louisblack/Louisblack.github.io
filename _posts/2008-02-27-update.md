Okay. Apologies for the lack of action on this blog over the last week. I&#8217;ve had a bit of an odd week. I am now jobless after being &#8216;let go&#8217; from my hideously boring role at &#8216;Driven Systems&#8217;. I&#8217;m currently looking for work but, as anyone from Brighton will tell you, it&#8217;s not easy in this town. Brighton seems to be made up of shop workers, bar staff and people selling insurance to each other over the phone.

I love living in Brighton but it does sometimes feel that you give up the right to have a decent job once you reach the end of the A23.

Oh well, only another three months and I&#8217;ll be jetting off around the world <img src="http://www.louishoughton.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" />
