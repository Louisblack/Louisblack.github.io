We left early on Saturday morning and got home around 9:30 Monday night so we had a good few days to see the main sights. Jordan had never been and I only have very vague memories of being there as a young child so it was fun wondering around seeing the famous landmarks.

I ended up getting a bit annoyed at the Louvre. I don&#8217;t particularly like crowds of tourists (hypocritical I know) and the Louvre seemed to encompass every tourist in Paris standing in front of me in a queue. We decided against actually going in due to the crowds. We then took a long stroll down the Champs-Élysées taking in the scenery and heading towards the Arc de Triomphe.

We started with baguettes for breakfast before heading over to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catacombs_of_Paris" target="_blank">Paris catacombs</a>. The queue was pretty horrific but the experience was definitely worth it. You can&#8217;t quite comprehend the number of dead people decorating the walls with their skulls and other bones. It&#8217;s not quite as spooky as you might think &#8211; just very daunting when you think about the time and effort that&#8217;s gone into the arrangement.

After the catacombs we headed over to the Eiffel Tower. I have a bit of a thing for tall buildings so we paid our 13€ and got the rickety lift to the top. The view is obviously impressive and the queues were actually much better than I expected. Jordan was impressed that they had a toilet on the top floor.

The meal was really tasty and was finishes nicely with a lovely chocolate fondant&#8230; mmmm.

The next day we wondered around Montmartre. We found the Moulin Rouge and ate at a brasserie that turned out to be a bit touristy and not actually very good.

Overall it was a pleasant getaway. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d go back again in a hurray though. Prices for hotels, food and drink are extortionate which can get a bit annoying. We also couldn&#8217;t work out why people find the city so romantic when everywhere smells of piss and you&#8217;re constantly dodging dog crap on the paths!
