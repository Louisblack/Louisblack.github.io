A week or so ago someone posted on Reddit a picture of their granddad and a list of every book he had read in his life. I&#8217;m trying to find the post but searching Reddit in the evening is painful. I think the list consisted of around 6000 books.

Now I know I&#8217;m a bit late but I&#8217;d like to start making a note of what I&#8217;ve read. Luckily I&#8217;ve spent the last year reading on a Kindle and move everything I finish into a collection. I only read one paper book so that&#8217;s pretty easy to remember.

So here&#8217;s 2011&#8217;s list in the order they were read&#8230;

The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde  
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Steig Larsson  
The Road by Cormac Mccarthy  
Cat&#8217;s Cradle: A Novel by Kurt Vonnegut  
The Sirens of Titan by Kurt Vonnegut  
Ender&#8217;s Game by Orson Scott Card  
Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick  
Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro  
Deathworld by Harry Harrison  
The Wasp Factory by Iain Banks  
Heart of Darkness by Joseph Conrad  
Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson  
Dune by Frank Herbert  
Bad Science by Ben Goldacre  
FahrenheitÂ 451 by Rad Bradbury  
The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien  
Consider Phlebas by Iain M. Banks  
Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke  
Snuff by Chuck Palahniuk  
Breakfast at Tiffany&#8217;s  
Oryx and Crake by Margaret Atwood  
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle  
The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath  
Hyperion by Dan Simmons  
Piano Player by Kurt Vonnegut  
The Graveyard Book by Neil Gaiman

Not a bad list. Before I got my Kindle I was barely reading at all. I&#8217;d stand in front of the book shelf and not see anything that took my fancy. Now I have a virtual book shelf of thousands of books that I can download in seconds.

My goal in 2012 is to finish reading all of Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s novels&#8230; I&#8217;ve already read three more this year <img src="http://www.louishoughton.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
