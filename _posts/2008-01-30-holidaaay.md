<span class="Apple-style-span" style=";font-family:Helvetica;font-size:85%;"  ><span style="font-size:100%;">My girlfriend, Jordan, and I booked flights for our holiday today. We are flying to L.A., then Auckland, then Tokyo, then Hong Kong and finally back to the U.K. We&#8217;re going for about two months in total and spending about two weeks in each city. I haven&#8217;t been outside of Europe in over seven years so it&#8217;s going to be a bit of an adventure. We now just need to book hostels and find out if we can stay with people while we&#8217;re out there&#8230; Oh, and save up some spending money.</span> </span>
