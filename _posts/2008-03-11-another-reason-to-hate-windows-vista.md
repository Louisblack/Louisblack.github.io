&#8230; As if you needed any more. 

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I&#8217;ll set the scene.  A friend of mine purchased a shiny new Sony Vaio laptop. It came pre-installed with Vista as most computers do nowadays. It quickly became a bit of a running joke &#8211; his two favourite wording being &#8216;fucking&#8217; and &#8216;Vista&#8217;. 
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Now I took it upon myself to tout the advantages of Ubuntu Linux &#8211; free software, easy installation, can easily dual boot with Windows.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  Or so I thought.
</div>

  Apparently Vista doesn&#8217;t like it when the partition it resides on is split or resized. I discovered this halfway through partitioning the drive using gParted.  This, as you can imagine, caused me quite a bit or worry. I had rendered my friend&#8217;s computer unusuable (well, it was running the Ubuntu Live CD fine). 
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  After much googling I found that Vista required me to insert the Vista DVD and perform a system repair which would put everything back to a nice workable state.

<div>
  This would be easy if it were not for the fact that my friend has a Sony Vaio. I like Sony, I think they make excellent consumer electronics but the fact that they don&#8217;t include system disks when you buy a computer is awful.  What you get is a &#8216;Recovery Partition&#8217; that not only steals 9GB from your hard drive but can only be booted from Vista (What the fuck!?!). 
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  So to fix my friends computer (well, I say fix, I mean return it to it&#8217;s previous state.  To fix it I would have to continue with the Ubuntu installation) I had to illegally download a copy of Vista just to use the system repair utility.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  I am now too scared to continue with the Ubuntu installation for fear of destroying everything on the Windows side. I am sure that this is a devilish ploy by Microsoft to stop people exploring the wonder that is Open Source computing and frankly, it will work. 
</div>

  I know I use a Mac, which is probably the most locked down system you can buy, but at least I made a conscious decision to buy one. Most people don&#8217;t know about anything outside of Windows and Microsoft is making it impossible for people to enlighten themselves. I&#8217;m not saying Windows doesn&#8217;t have it&#8217;s uses (such as gaming) but a basic Linux installation would be sufficient for 80% of computer users. We just need to move away from the Windows-centric model where everything on the internet is explained as though you are using Internet Explorer.

  Anyway, this is probably a subject for a whole other post&#8230;
