So here it is. My (I think) forth attempt at blogging. My <a href="http://louishoughton.blogspot.com" target="_blank">last blog</a> fell into disrepair whilst I was working in the media industry. I kept wanting to write about what a horrible time I was having and what bastards I had to take orders from but I was always too worried about potential employers Googling my name and finding a post where I bad mouthed their closest and dearest friend in the industry. Â I didn&#8217;t really have much else to talk about due to the fact that I was sometimes working 60 hour weeks and didn&#8217;t really get much time to do more interesting things.

So I just stopped.

My last post was in April. So at least it has been less than a year.

My last blog was also lacking personality. For some unknown reason I didn&#8217;t tend to talk about things that I did or places I went. I think I had ideas above my station and took the whole thing a little too seriously. I hope that this one will be a little more personal. As well as that I&#8217;ll probably end up writing about my many interests like computers, video games, films, books, travelling and whatever else pops in to my head. I&#8217;ll also cover what I&#8217;m doing in my Open University course maybe.

By the way, I haven&#8217;t really spent any time fiddling with things on here so I&#8217;m sure there are many rough edges. This is my first time using my own proper webserver (I did have a paid Geocities account back in the day but the less said about that the better) so I&#8217;m still working things out. I settled upon using [WordPress ][1] as they have an iPhone application for blog management. I wonder how many decisions are made by that fact. The Natwest bank iPhone app almost had me tempted&#8230;

Anyway, that&#8217;s enough for tonight but I will hopefully make my first post soon.

Good night.
