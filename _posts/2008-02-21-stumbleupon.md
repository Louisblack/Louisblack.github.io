I have recently discovered the genius of this little toolbar. [Stumbleupon][1] looks at your interests (defined by you when you sign up, not by scary surveillance) and finds random websites for your entertainment. My interests included the obvious technology (Mac OSX, open source), linguistics, atheism, and of course humour (bizzare preferably). I&#8217;ve had some good finds so far with an [interesting essay][2] by Richard Dawkins, a [nerdy conversation][3] between people through IM and the beautiful picture above.

I just thought I&#8217;d put that one in for the family guy fans&#8230;

I recommend it wholeheartedly, especially if your job is anywhere near as boring as mine. I just wish they made one for Safari.
