Apologies for the lack of updates recently. I&#8217;m moving house in two weeks and going on holiday in three so I have been completely rushed off my feet. I am therefore a few days late with my opinions on the new Cure single.

  First off, I must say that I was a little annoyed that I preordered the single a week before it&#8217;s tuesday release date and it didn&#8217;t reach me until thursday.  That&#8217;s two days that I had to resist spending £1.5o on iTunes or going the morally dubious route of bittorrent. I resisted in the end as I wanted my first listen to be the CD through my pretty decent stereo.

  I have now had the opportunity to give the single and it&#8217;s B-side, NY Trip, a few listens and have formed a few initial opinions. Firstly, The Only One is definitely closer to The Cure&#8217;s later efforts such as High from the Wish album. It&#8217;s an uplifting love song with (surprisingly due to the recent line up change) a dreamy, Cure-esque keyboard track underlying the chorus. Robert Smith wails over a more rocky guitar sound and the tempo keeps up throughout the entire track. It&#8217;s a song that grows on you, although it never really started out bad.

  Of course, this is all coming from a deeply devoted Cure fan who dislikes very few songs in their back catalogue, so I wouldn&#8217;t take too much notice of this little review.

  This week I have also been listening Nine Inch Nail&#8217;s new album that they released free of change. It seems to be following their recent trend of moving into more guitar driven music which I&#8217;m a little disappointed about. The earlier albums that consisted mainly of programmed loops sounded a great deal more original than the more generic rock/metal albums released over the last few years. Oh well, at least it was free.
