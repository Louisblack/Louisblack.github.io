I&#8217;ve just finished watching Eastern Promises, David Cronenberg&#8217;s latest film. One thing I really can&#8217;t get my head around is that fact that Cronenberg is not considered one of modern cinemas greats. His last two films, A History of Violence and Eastern Promises, are arguably two of the most stunning pieces of cinema of this century. Both films have been highly praised by critics but very few people seem to have seen them and although recognition from the film academy has provided a few nominations, performances from Viggo Mortensen and Cronenberg&#8217;s direction clearly deserve more.

  As anyone who speaks to me will know, The Fly is one of my all time favourite movies. I also consider Videodrome and Scanners as two of the best ventures into body horror by any director. Cronenberg, however, has moved away from the grotesque body and seems to be focusing realistic and altogether more disturbing event &#8211; violence, human trafficking, rape and families being torn apart by lies (made even more frightening when it&#8217;s set in your future home city).

  These latest ventures may not make your skin crawl like watching Jeff Goldblum pull out his finger nails but at least you know the chances of becoming a human/fly hybrid are slim to none&#8230; getting embroiled with the Russian Mafia on the other hand&#8230;
