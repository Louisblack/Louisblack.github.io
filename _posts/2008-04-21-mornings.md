The only reason I look forward to Monday morning is Charlie Brooker&#8217;s excellent weekly column on the Guardian website. I could read it in the Sunday paper but I&#8217;m high-tech&#8230; and I like killing 5 minutes at work whilst pealing crusty chunks out of my sleep deprived eye sockets.

  <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/21/workandcareers">This weeks column</a> got me worried. I have never been good in the mornings.  I do always get up on time for work, but it&#8217;s not easy or pretty. I have, however, always been under the impression that once I hit my mid to late twenties I will enjoy getting up early.  I will be up and eating an elaborate breakfast at 8am on a Saturday morning whilst planning the days activities.

  Well, it seems this will never happen as I believe I see more of my morning thoughts and feelings in our friend Charlie&#8217;s little rant than is practically healthy. It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t get enough sleep.  It&#8217;s just that getting up with 7 hours sleep in a lot more palatable at noon than it is at 8am.

  Oh well, at least I have Charlie to greet me good morning on that most terrible of days.
