Oh dear. Today I found out that the city I will be living in from August will be run by a cartoon character.

    We British officially now have no right to make fun of Americans electing celebrities as politicians. At least Arney was in Terminator 2, which was much more of a success than our friend Boris could ever hope for from his TV appearances (which mainly consisted of him being humiliated by Paul Merton and Ian Hislop on Have I Got News For You).

    From watching interviews with Boris supporters from around the city, I get the feeling that people have incredibly short memories. This is a man who vehemently opposed gay marriage, attacked Liverpool so soon after the beheading of Ken Bigley and is essentially a racist &#8211; not really a great choice for the face of London. Just look at the controversies section on his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boris_Johnson#Controversies">Wikipedia page</a>!
