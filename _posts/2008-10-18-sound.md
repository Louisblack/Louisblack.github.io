It&#8217;s been weeks since my last post and I&#8217;m afraid this one isn&#8217;t really going to make up for the lack of attention being paid to this blog at the moment.

  Lying in bed this morning I was flicking through the channels and ended up settling on Sound which is a trendy music show presented by Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac and generic, indie funny-man Nick Grimshaw. This usually isn&#8217;t my thing but I do sometimes like to see what music is popular nowadays.

  There was a band&#8230; no wait, that&#8217;s the wrong word&#8230; I&#8217;m not quite sure how to describe them. Think of Blazin Squad with only three members and one of those members being female&#8230; got it? They are called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/ndubz">N Dubs</a> if you want to look them up or maybe listen to a 30 second preview on iTunes.  You know, just for fun.

  Well, (the?) N Dubs were being interviewed by the aforementioned Annie and Nick and were discussing how they feel that they have worked really hard to get where they are and, even though they respect other artists who don&#8217;t write their own songs, they see themselves as more credible because they do everything.

  It then cut to their performance of a song called <a href="http://www.1songlyrics.com/n/n-dubs/ouch.html">Ouch</a>. Now bear in mind that they have just &#8216;bigged up&#8217; their song writing skills in the interview section. The chorus consists of the line &#8216;I loved you so much but you cheated on me&#8217; and &#8216;You need to recognise that she was just a whore.&#8217;

  Top notch lyrics if you ask me.
