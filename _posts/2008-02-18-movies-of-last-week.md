Okay, so I meant to do this yesterday (it would have been a lot more logical) but better late than never. I&#8217;ve decided to make a list of films I watch each week, just to keep track if anything.

This week I have mostly been watching&#8230;

Atonement  
Casablanca  
Young Frankenstein  
Dangerous Minds  
Don Jaun Demarco

I feel bad that this is the first time I had watched Casablanca, especially after doing a film degree! I am glad to say that I wasn&#8217;t disappointed &#8211; Bogey is always a pleasure to watch.  
Atonement, however, was fairly awful. The excellent James Mcavoy just couldn&#8217;t make up for the talentless Ikea Knightly (nod to Mark Kermode) and it really felt a wee bit pretentious in it&#8217;s playing to the Oscar crowd.

I&#8217;m hoping on Friday to make it to the late night screening of Bladerunner (Final Cut) at the Duke of York. Other than that, I have a few films I would like to watch or re-watch this week including M and a few more James Cagney&#8217;s from Jordan&#8217;s new box set.
