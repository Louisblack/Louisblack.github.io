This year&#8217;s reading achievement definitely has to be finishing all of Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s novels. I had them all downloaded on my Kindle so whenever I finished a book and couldn&#8217;t think of what to ready next I would randomly choose a Vonnegut book and ready that. They also make a nice change after epics like Game of Thrones and Hyperion due to their short length and light heartedness.

The standout book of the year is probably Ready Player One. I didn&#8217;t really know what to expect beyond the geek and 80s references everyone talks about so the engaging story and likeable characters were a nice surprise.

Next year I want to start reading a bit more horror. I love horror movies but I&#8217;m not very knowledgeable on horror novels at all so I think I&#8217;ll try and change that. I&#8217;ve just finished The Rats so that&#8217;s a start.
