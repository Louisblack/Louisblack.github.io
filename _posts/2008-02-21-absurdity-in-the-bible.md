Another gem found with the wonders of Stumbleupon. [Here][1] is a site about the absurdities of the bible. This is my favourite one about the after effects of the great flood&#8230;

&#8216;God is rightly filled with remorse for having killed his creatures. He makes a deal with the animals, promising never to drown them all again. He even puts the rainbow in the sky so that whenever he sees it, it will remind him of his promise so that he won&#8217;t be tempted to do it again. (Every time God sees the rainbow he says to himself: &#8220;Oh, yeah&#8230;. That&#8217;s right. I promised not to drown the animals again. I guess I&#8217;ll have to find something else to do.&#8221;). [9:9-13][2]&#8216;
