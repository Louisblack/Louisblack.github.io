  <h2>Louis Houghton</h2>
  <p>
    I am an independent software consultant with over a decade of experience designing, building and testing complex software systems.
    I have worked with organisations such as Yell, Legal and General, the Ministry of Justice and the Open University to help
    transform their digital offerings.
  </p>

  <p>
    My languages of choice are Java and Javascript. I consider myself a full stack developer with experience working on both the front
    and backend. I have used the Spring framework to build backend services for around 10 years. I've used several frontend frameworks
    like Angular, Vue and React.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have helped with large cloud infrastructure migrations and designed cloud native solutions.
    In a previous role I migrated a fleet of EC2 VMs to containers running on ECS and static content served by S3 and Cloudfront.
    Containers were deployed using Github Actions and CodeDeploy using blue/green and canary deployments.
