This is probably my forth attempt at blogging. My last attempt was my longest yet so I am hoping that the upward trend will continue and this one will last a lot longer.

I am software engineer who specialises in Java and JavaScript and I'm currently based in Milton Keynes.

My main interests are coding, cycling and traveling.

I have a wife called Jordan, two cats Fritz and Sailor and a smelly dog called Ernest.
