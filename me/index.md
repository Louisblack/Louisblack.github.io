I am software engineer who specialises in Java and JavaScript and I'm currently based in Milton Keynes. I've been writing code professionally for over six years. I've worked on massive enterprise Java systems within finance and e-commerce. I've written screen building solutions and MVC frameworks in JavaScript. I've even spent a year managing databases.

I'm passionate about code quality. I've introduced tools such as Sonarqube and practices such as front end unit testing at companies I've worked at. Check out my code over at [Github](http://www.github.com/louisblack).

I speak about interests like code quality, IoT and other technical topics.

If you want to hire me to help with your project or speak at your event, get in touch at louis${at}louishoughton.com.

My main interests are coding, cycling and traveling.

I have a wife called Jordan, two cats Fritz and Sailor and a smelly dog called Ernest.
