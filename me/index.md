This is probably my forth attempt at blogging. My last attempt was my longest yet so I am hoping that the upward trend will continue and this one will last a lot longer.

I am a developer and consultant for a small software company in Milton Keynes. I&#8217;m also studying towards my second degree &#8211; Computing at the Open University. I program in Java and Perl.

In a past life I was a runner at a  Soho based television post production house. Several factors led to me leaving the job and rethinking my life in the media industry. I still have a keen interest in media but I can&#8217;t see myself moving back into it any time soon.

My main interests are technology, films, music, and video games. I&#8217;m a Mac user but dabble in Linux here and there. My (current generation) gaming machines are an XBox 360, PS3,  iPhone 5 and my Macbook Pro.

I have a girlfriend called Jordan and two cats &#8211; Fritz and Sailor
